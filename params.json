Postworthy allows you to create a website filled with the things you find and the things \r\nfound by those you follow on twitter.\r\n\r\nPostworthy has been created in C# and has been designed to run on multiple operating systems \r\n(postworthy.com is actually a linux server).\r\n\r\nThe project is also mobile ready right out of the box to see this visit the demo link above from your smartphone (iOS or Android).\r\n\r\n##Project Features\r\n==================================\r\n\r\n* C# MVC3 (Razor View Engine)\r\n* Mobile Ready\r\n* Automatic Content Ranking\r\n* NoSql\r\n* Memcached\r\n* Twitter API\r\n* Runs on Mono (the demo is running on Mono)\r\n\r\n##Tools\r\n==================================\r\nIf you are not familiar with C# then you will want to have a look at these free development tools\r\n\r\n#####Windows\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express\">Visual Studio 2010 Express</a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.couchbase.com/memcached\">Couchbase</a>\r\n\r\n#####Mac & Linux\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://monodevelop.com/\">MonoDevelop</a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.couchbase.com/memcached\">Couchbase</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n##Before You Build\r\n==================================\r\nBefore you build you will want to sign up for a twitter account and sign up for a <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/\">twitter api key</a>. \r\nPostworthy uses the twitter API to find content that you share and also to find content shared by those you follow. \r\nYou will also want to authorize your twitter account to be used by your application.\r\n\r\n#####Twitter Keys\r\n\r\nBefore you run the application for the first time you will need to sign up for the twitter developer api.\r\nYou will need to use the example.web.config file in the Postworthy.Web project to create a web.config\r\nand also use the example.app.config in the UpdateRepository project to create an app.config file.\r\n\r\nYou will then need to authorize your twitter account and use the  example.userscollection.config \r\nfile in the Postworthy.Web directory to create a userscollection.config file.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your twitter account ready you will want to modify the PrimaryUser in both the web.config and \r\nthe app.config.\r\n\r\n#####UsersCollection References\r\n\r\nIn both the web.config and the app.config you will need to modify the UsersCollection setting to point \r\nto your UsersCollection file. You will also need to make sure that the process running your web application has both read \r\nand write access to this file.\r\n\r\n#####Memcached\r\n\r\nYou will need to have a local memcached instance running on your development machine. Postworthy is a NoSQL project\r\nand Memcached allows for scalability as well as a speedy place to store frequently used data. By default Postworthy expects \r\nthe memcached instance to be running local and be available on port 11211.","name":"Postworthy","google":"UA-642235-10"}
